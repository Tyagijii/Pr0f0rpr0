If you want to loop though both the elements of a list and have an index for the elements as well, you can use
Python's enumerate function:
for index, item in enumerate(['one', 'two', 'three', 'four']):
 print(index, '::', item)
enumerate will generate tuples, which are unpacked into index (an integer) and item (the actual value from the list).
The above loop will print
(0, '::', 'one')
(1, '::', 'two')
(2, '::', 'three')
(3, '::', 'four')
