extend(enumerable) â€“ extends the list by appending elements from another enumerable.
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7]
b = [8, 9, 10]
# Extend list by appending all elements from b
a.extend(b)
# a: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# Extend list with elements from a non-list enumerable:
a.extend(range(3))
# a: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0, 1, 2]
Lists can also be concatenated with the + operator. Note that this does not modify any of the original lists

zip returns a list of tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the argument
sequences or iterables:
alist = ['a1', 'a2', 'a3']
blist = ['b1', 'b2', 'b3']
for a, b in zip(alist, blist):
 print(a, b)
# Output:
# a1 b1
# a2 b2
# a3 b3
If the lists have different lengths then the result will include only as many elements as the shortest one
